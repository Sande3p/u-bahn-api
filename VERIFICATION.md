## Verification
The verification needs data in ES, there are two ways to populate data to ES.

Please install and run [kibana](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/kibana-6-8-0), validate data in ES during the testing, I found this is very useful for developing and testing.
The data in ES is confusing, please validate data in ES before making a decision success or failure.

#### Using u-bahn-api service
Start the `u-bahn-api` service and create data with postman.
As you create data, verify data is read from ES using resource GET methods from postman.
When create a resource, the postman sets the Id of corresponding resource, so be carefully after create resource

According to the [forum](https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=956692&start=0), 
the u-bahn topics isn't set up in TC bus api, so the posting message to bus API doesn't work currently.
Fix TC bus api to accept u-bahn topics, please use this approach, this is the easiest way.


#### Using u-bahn-es-processor

Publish messages to [u-bahn-es-processor](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/u-bahn-es-processor) through kafka. 
This is very hard and error prune, but if this is the only way, use this approach.

Follow the instructions in the README file in the `u-bahm-es-processor`, start kafka server, start elasticsearch, initialize Elasticsearch, start `u-bahn-es-processor` app

1. start kafka-console-producer to write messages to `u-bahn.action.create`
topic:
  `docker exec -it ubahn-data-processor-es_kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic u-bahn.action.create`
3. write message:
  `{"topic":"u-bahn.action.create","originator":"u-bahn-api","timestamp":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","mime-type":"application/json","payload":{"resource":"user","id":"391a3656-9a01-47d4-8c6d-64b68c44f212","handle":"user"}}`
4. Watch the app console, It will show message successfully handled.
